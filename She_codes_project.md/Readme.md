# üå¶Ô∏è Weather App - Python Basics Project

As part of the SheCodes Python Basics Workshop, I developed a Weather App that utilizes live data fetched from an external API. This project was a result of my learning experience where I mastered the fundamental elements of Python, logical operators, and data structuring techniques.
Key Features:
- Real-time Weather Data: The app fetches and displays live weather updates using API integration.
- User-friendly Interface: Clean and simple interface, allowing users to easily check the weather for any location.
- Dynamic Data Handling: Efficiently structures and processes data within the code, ensuring accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts.

This project demonstrates my ability to apply core Python concepts to build functional and practical applications.
