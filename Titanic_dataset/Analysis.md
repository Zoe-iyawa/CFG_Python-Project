# Titanic Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis project! This project contains a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset includes various attributes of passengers, such as age, sex, class, and survival status. This analysis aims to explore these features to uncover 
patterns and insights related to survival rates. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, this project seeks to 
understand the factors that contributed to the likelihood of survival.

## Goals
Exploratory Analysis: Investigate the relationships between different features and survival rates.
Visualization: Generate charts and graphs to visually represent trends and insights.
Insights: Draw conclusions about the significance of various factors in predicting survival.

# Insights
1. How does survival vary by sex ?
The survival count is higher in female group than male. In the early 20th century, societal norms often placed women and children in a more protected and valued role compared to men.
This shows this principle was enforced aboard the ship
2. How survival vary by class ?
Priority was giving to people in First class especially women. The early 20th century society was characterized by strong social hierarchies and class distinctions.
The analysis shows that people with wealthier backgrounds and held higher social status heavily influenced the decision-making process during the evacuation.
Again the 'Women and children first' principle was applied heavily.
3. How does survival rate vary by number of sibling ?
Passenger with fewer family members on board had a higher survival rate. This could be because passengers with fewer family members are sometimes more easier to manage and coordinate.
4. How does average fare affect survival ?
The average fare is higher and so as survival count. This could be because people who usuallly bought the pricier tickets are usuallly people with
higher social status. They may have influenced the decision-making process during the evacuation.
5. Survival rate for people based on number of parents ?
There was higher survival rate of passengers on the Titanic who were traveling without parents or had little to no guidance from a family member.
This could be because passengers traveling alone or without parents were generally more mobile and independent, allowing them to act quickly and
 make decisions for themselves during the chaos of the evacuation. Also, priority was given to women and children, as they were given priority in lifeboat evacuations.
